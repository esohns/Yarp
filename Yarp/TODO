[LIBRARY]
[GENERAL - TOUGH]
- [map] map generation hangs/seems to hang sometimes ("segmenting area...")
- [net UNIX/WIN] optimize proactor support (UNIX: test DevPoll)
- [net UNIX/WIN] run stress-tests, increase maximum number of concurrent
 connections/system
- [net] confirm valgrind reports of minor memory leak in
 RPG_Net_Module_SocketHandler::bisectMessages
- the timer queue seems to be (!) unstable (--> try another implementation/strategy ?)
[- [XML] validation throws exceptions
 (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESC-1975)]
- [client/UI] excessive CPU usage (probably AI-related)
- [client/UI] excessive CPU usage (probably SDL-related: improve event loop logic)
- [graphics] refactor isometric 2D client

[GENERAL - MODERATE]
- [magic] define more (low-level) spells, player generation fails sometimes...
- [client/UI] switch from libglade to GtkBuilder
- [(xerces) XML parser] handle all defined SAXParser exceptions

[GENERAL - EASY]
- add more monster types
- add more sounds
- add level-up logic
- add more graphics
- add more sounds
- add CD music support
- [PLATFORM/installation] remove/obsolete BASEDIR macro
- [PLATFORM] consolidate new-operator usage
- [xerces/XML] define/implement XML parser schema cache
- [character] refine sub-project structure
- [engine] refine entity sprite concept
- [graphics] refactor/encapsulate window system
- evaluate *TODO* tags
- rethink DEBUG_RELEASE macro: support debugging out of the source tree ?

[MISCELLANEOUS]
- [doc] define coding (style) guidelines
- [doc] API documentation
- consider introducing exceptions for (non-)critical error-handling

[TEST_U]
[GENERAL]
- some unit tests do not need a console window

[SDL_GUI]
- intermittent ASSERT when mouse leaves/hovers near left screen edge
  {--> dirty region rect .x = -16 ?}
- highlight is not drawn correctly
- cursor is not drawn correctly (mysterious: "debug" mode seems to work OK !)
- when the mouse pointer leaves the screen, the cached backgrounds need to be flushed
- cursor is not drawn correctly when (hovering) over border
- when an entity leaves a highlighted position, the bg cache
 (cursor/highglight) needs to be invalidated
- 2D: entities are erroneously (re-)drawn OVER SE walls (should be behind)
