known issues (hard and benign):
- [map] map generation hangs/seems to hang sometimes ("segmenting area...")
- [net UNIX/WIN] proactor support is broken on UNIX systems and flaky on WINDOWS
? [net] race condition when operating at the maximum number of connections on UNIX:
        when the acceptor/connector rejects a new connection due to this limit,
        there is a gap between closing the socket and deregistering with the
        event dispatcher (pro/reactor)
[- [XML] validation throws an exception (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESC-1975)]

known issues (soft and juicy):
+ [magic] define more (low-level) spells, player generation fails sometimes...
+ [net] connection cleanup is broken
