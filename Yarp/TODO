[GENERAL - TOUGH]
- [map] map generation hangs/seems to hang sometimes ("segmenting area...")
- [net UNIX/WIN] optimize proactor support (UNIX: test DevPoll)
- [net UNIX/WIN] run stress-tests, increase maximum number of concurrent
 connections/system
- [net] confirm valgrind reports of minor memory leak in
 RPG_Net_Module_SocketHandler::bisectMessages
- the timer implementation seems to be unstable (--> try another timer queue ?)
[- [XML] validation throws exceptions
 (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESC-1975)]
- [client/UI] excessive CPU usage (probably AI-related)
- [client/UI] excessive CPU usage (probably SDL-related: improve event loop logic)

[TEST_U]
[GENERAL]
- some unit tests do not need a console window

[SDL_GUI]
- hide active position highlight when cursor position is invalid
- cursor is not drawn correctly when (hovering) over border
- when an entity leaves a highlighted position, the bg cache
 (cursor/highglight) needs to be invalidated
- entities are erroneously (re-)drawn OVER SE walls (should be behind)
