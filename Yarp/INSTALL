Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Building and Installing the source code and unit test binaries
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you can read this, then you probably have already obtained either a tarball
 or a package containing the project source code and installed the source tree
somewhere on your machine.

1.1. Building on UNIX/POSIX-like systems
----------------------------------------
To build the source code and binaries, make sure that you have a compiler
 toolchain, make and the GNU autotools installed.

Generate the 'configure' script using the standard procedure (I use 
'autoreconf -i').

 In order to keep the source tree clean, I suggest you do a so-called VPATH
 build (Note that this may be restricted to GNU make users): from the 
directory where this file is located, create a subdirectory (e.g. 'build').
 Change to that directory and invoke the 'configure' script from there, using
 your favourite option settings. Once the Makefile has been generated, run 
'make' (and 'make install'). Note that the default INSTALL_PREFIX is
 '/usr/local'.

1.2. Building on Windows-like systems
-------------------------------------
To build the source code and binaries, make sure that you have a compiler
 toolchain (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio) installed. Alternatively, consider
installing a GNU environment like 'Cygwin' and follow the instructions above.
